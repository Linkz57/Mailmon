# Mailmon v1.0 by Kyle Claisse
# This script reads in an email in text form and executes certain functions based on the content of the message.
#
# This bash script was cobbled together quickly with no thought to how anyone else would use it so its not the best.
# I rewrote this in python which is much easier to work with if you know python. See mailmon2.py

## Kyle originally wrote a very efficient and elegant script,
## which I have now stolen, modified, and bloated out to perform a similar job.

## To increase readability and reduce size, here's a bunch of words I would normally have to repeat in most email conditions.
usualSteps="\n -Open the Hyper-V Manager MMC Snap-In and connect to OMITTED\n -Right-click the machine you want to resurrect, and select Settings...\n -Under IDE Controller 0 click Browse... and replace the VHD with the newest VHD as created by Disk2VHD\n -Under IDE Controller 1 click Browse... and replace the VHD with the second-newest VHD as created by UrBackup. Depending on when this machine died, urBackup might have been in the middle of its backup. Don't use the latest one, it might be unfinished. Use the penultimate VHD instead\n -Change its Network Adapter to OMITTED\n -click OK, and then Start on the right\n -Consider logging into the server once it's booted to disable and stop the UrBackup client service from services.msc and the disk2vhd task from the Windows Task Scheduler"
